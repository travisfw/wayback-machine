This installation guide assumes the reader is already familiar with
building, packaging and deploying Nutch 1.0-dev.


The NutchWAX 0.12 source and build system are designed to integrate
into the existing Nutch 1.0-dev source and build.

The long-term goal is for the NutchWAX components to be fully
integrated into mainline Nutch.  As a stepping-stone toward that goal,
we have packaged the NutchWAX source to be dropped into the Nutch
"contrib" directory and built from there.

Like Nutch, NutchWAX 0.12 uses a simple 'ant' build script.  The
NutchWAX build script calls out to the Nutch script to build Nutch
proper, then builds NutchWAX components and integrates them into the
Nutch build directory.

We recommend that you execute all build commands from the NutchWAX
directory.  This way, NutchWAX will ensure that any and all
dependencies in Nutch will be properly built and kept up-to-date.
Towards this goal, we have duplicated the most common build targets
from the Nutch 'build.xml' file to the NutchWAX 'build.xml' file,
such as:

  o compile
  o jar
  o job
  o tar
  o clean

Again, the idea is that if you're already used to building Nutch, you
can easily transition to building Nutch and NutchWAX together.  All of
the build artifacts will still be placed in Nutch's 'build'
sub-directory as normal.


Nutch-1.0-dev
-------------
As mentioned above, NutchWAX 0.12 is built against Nutch-1.0-dev.
Nutch doesn't have a 1.0 release package yet, so we have to use the
Nutch SVN trunk.  The specific SVN revision that NutchWAX 0.12 is
built against is:

  650739

To checkout this revision of Nutch, use:

 $ svn checkout -r 650739 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/nutch/trunk nutch
 $ cd nutch


NutchWAX
--------
Once you have Nutch-1.0-dev checked-out, check-out NutchWAX into
Nutch's "contrib" directory.

 $ cd contrib
 $ svn checkout http://archive-access.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-access/trunk/archive-access/projects/nat/archive

This will create a sub-directory named "archive" containing the
NutchWAX sources.


Build and install
-----------------
Assuming you already have the required tool-set for building Nutch,
building NutchWAX is a snap.

Simply execute the same 'ant' build command in

  nutch/contrib/archive

as you normally would and everything will build as normal.

For example

  $ cd nutch/contrib/archive
  $ ant tar

This command will build all of Nutch, then the NutchWAX add-ons and
finally will package everything up into the "nutch-1.0-dev.tar.gz"
release package.

Then, install the "nutch-1.0-dev.tar.gz" tarball as normal.  For
example:

  $ cd /opt
  $ tar xvfz nutch-1.0-dev.tar.gz
