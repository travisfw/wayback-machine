== NGWM NEXT STEPS ==

0.2 (week of Nov 28 - Dec 2)
 - fix windows file-pipeline bug (move pipeline state into bdb?)
 - better install/admin instructions (in file and in UI)
 - bundle small default dataset (sample ARC) for immediate use
 - remove extraneous files from build distro bundle
 - polish UI to clarify local operation/collection/etc.
 - release via SF 'file release' mechanism, announce to lists
 - demo for team next Tuesday (Dec 6) for UI/feature feedback

  
0.4 (by first week of January)
 - verified performance at typical scale of contract collections 
 - retrieve/cache/respect freshest robots.txt
 - nice, flexible results-list UI (classic calendar or other)
 
0.6 (July 14, 2006)
 - administrative/manual exclusions
 - timeline UI ala WERA with in-page banner
 
0.8 (August 2006)
 - multiple collections within single installation? (currently possible with multiple webapps)
 - static, manually maintained alphabetic division of index for larger scale installations
 - retrieval on demand from live web

1.0 (December 2006)
 - automatically maintained distributed index
 - basis for production Wayback Machine replacement
 
== BRAINSTORMING ==

 Error-handling: 
 - when URL not available
   - if auto-fetch, make sure an in-page floaty announces that it's
     a fresh retrieve; log to side for QA purposes
   - if not auto-fetch, offer link to broader search (all local collections)
     or remote collections (such as public wayback machine)
 
 Entry pages:
 - when scanning ARCs, offer option to add /root pages to 'entry pages' list
 - also allow admin to add entry pages
 - display recommended entry pages below main search box (or on separate page)

 Search/Admin UI:
 - make host, collection very clear in UI (unless suppressed)
 - highlight especially 'localhost' connections (different color background?)
 - ape google/search-engine style to maximum extent practical
 
 Replay UI:
 - in-page presence
   - collapsable uri/date/collection indicator
   - mouseover indicators?
 - n/a graphic for n/a images
 - stayback firefox extension
   - would look for special indicator inside page that it's a wayback session
   - if found, would refuse to load inline resources or follow clicks without
     patching URI back to wayback machine (assuming intercept/callback is 
     possible)
 
 Heritrix integration ideas:
 - bundled? just installed alongside?
 - simultaneous update during crawl? 
 - 'not here yet but scheduled' error/placeholder IMGs?
 - schedule-when-requested-via-WM?
 - linkify all logs/reports to WM?
