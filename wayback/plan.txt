== BRAINSTORMING ==

 Error-handling: 
 - when URL not available
   - if auto-fetch, make sure an in-page floaty announces that it's
     a fresh retrieve; log to side for QA purposes
   - if not auto-fetch, offer link to broader search (all local collections)
     or remote collections (such as public wayback machine)
 
 Entry pages:
 - when scanning ARCs, offer option to add /root pages to 'entry pages' list
 - also allow admin to add entry pages
 - display recommended entry pages below main search box (or on separate page)

 Search/Admin UI:
 - make host, collection very clear in UI (unless suppressed)
 - highlight especially 'localhost' connections (different color background?)
 - ape google/search-engine style to maximum extent practical
 
 Replay UI:
 - in-page presence
   - collapsable uri/date/collection indicator
   - mouseover indicators?
 - n/a graphic for n/a images
 - stayback firefox extension
   - would look for special indicator inside page that it's a wayback session
   - if found, would refuse to load inline resources or follow clicks without
     patching URI back to wayback machine (assuming intercept/callback is 
     possible)
 
 Heritrix integration ideas:
 - bundled? just installed alongside?
 - simultaneous update during crawl? 
 - 'not here yet but scheduled' error/placeholder IMGs?
 - schedule-when-requested-via-WM?
 - linkify all logs/reports to WM?
