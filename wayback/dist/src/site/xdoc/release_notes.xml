      <p>
        Full listing of changes and bug fixes are not currently available prior
        to release 1.2.0.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Release 1.4.0">
      <subsection name="Features">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>@</b> Completely new implementation of ResourceStore classes,
            including recursive local directory scanning, scanning multiple
            local directories, an experimental remote directory scanning
            capability, and groundwork for future support of both non ARC/WARC
            file formats and large scale automatic indexing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>@</b> Complete overhaul of the Replay system, allowing
            jspInserts within ArchivalUrl, DomainPrefix, and Proxy replay
            modes. Also includes groundwork for future fine-grained mime-type
            and url-based Replay customizations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added capability to explicitly set Locale to use for an
            AccessPoint, overriding the default behavior of using the user
            agents specified preferred language.
          </li>
          <li>
            New flat file implementation of FileLocationDB. See 
            CDXCollection.xml within the .war file for and example usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            AnchorDate feature, tracking the date with which a user begins a 
            replay session. During this session, wayback will always attempt to
            remain near this date, preventing time-drift within a replay 
            session.
          </li>
          <li>
            AnchorWindow feature, which allows users to specify a maximum time
            window in either direction of the AnchorDate that they wish to view
            replayed content. When a user has set this option, Wayback will not
            display captures outside the specified window.
          </li>
          <li>
            New command line tool <b>location-db</b> to create a location DB
            offline, populating with lines read from STDIN.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added new AccessControlSettingOperation authentication control
            component, allowing the configuration of the appropriate Exclusion
            system per-request, as defined by arbitrary BooleanOperators. See
            ComplexAccessPoint.xml within the .war file for an example usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added .asx archival URL replay, which rewrites links inside
            archived .asx files, attempting to make them point back into the
            Wayback service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now accept "http:/" as identical to "http://" in the beginning of
            a URL, working around a browser bug which stripped multiple "/"s in
            URL paths.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>@</b> Refactoring of ResourceIndex interfaces, to allow for
            future update-able ResourceIndex implementations beyond BDBIndex
            based ResourceIndexes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b> Major internal refactoring of WaybackRequest object,
            providing more stable get/set methods for accessing the standard
            internal fields with type-safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b> Major internal refactoring of SearchResults into
            CaptureSearchResults and UrlSearchResults, which was previously
            under-specified and often confusing. These new classes provide more
            stable get/set methods for accessing the standard internal fields
            with type-safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b> Changed locations of replay, query, and exception .jsp
            files within .war file to underneath WEB-INF, so they are not
            directly accessible via HTTP.
          </li>
          <li>
            German translation of default Wayback UI. Thanks Andreas! 
          </li>
          <li>
            Czech translation of default Wayback UI. Thanks Lukáš Matějka!

            <a href="http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/ACC-29">ACC-29</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            All threads now notified of shut downs, allowing resources to be
            released cleanly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b>Refactor of all Request and Result related constants from
            WaybackConstants to WaybackRequest and the *SearchResult(s) 
            classes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>*</b> Refactor of the various UI*Results classes, which are used
            by Query, Replay, and Exception .jsp files to access context 
            information into the single class, UIResults, which has a more
            stable interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            New AccessPoint.urlRoot optional configuration, enabling explicit
            control over URLs generated for the UI.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Bug Fixes">
        <ul>
          <li>
            (ACC-24) Fixed bug in Proxy mode which prevented the correct number
            of results from being returned from the index during Replay.
          </li>
          <li>
            (ACC-21) fixed bug where some CSS import declarations where not
            being correctly rewritten.
          </li>
          <li>
            (ACC-26) fixed rare String OOB exception when marking up pages with
            some forms of Javascript generated HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            (ACC-28) verifies that detected encoding is supported in local JVM
            before attempting to decode a resource into a String.
          </li>
          <li>
            (unreported) fixed declared page encoding of help, advanced search
            and index page to UTF-8.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explicitly set character encoding on returned documents, instead of
            relying on Tomcat to return the correct encoding.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Migration notes to 1.4.0 from 1.2.X">
        <p>
          Wayback 1.4.0 includes substantial code changes aimed at extending
          current capabilities, enabling planned future features, and
          stabilizing interfaces used in .jsp customizations. Since these
          changes would already require a significant update of existing
          customizations made to .jsp files, many non-vital cleanups to the
          source tree were included. The goal of implementing all of these
          features within this single release is to minimize future required
          updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a somewhat inclusive list of changes that will be required
          when upgrading to Wayback 1.4.0 from 1.2.X, divided into two main
          categories: changes required to Spring configuration, and changes
          required for .jsp customizations. Depending on the scope of the
          existing customizations in your installations, it may be simpler
          to modify your existing customizations to conform to new interfaces
          and packages, and in other cases, it may be simpler to begin with the
          new reference implementations and modify them to meet your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are changes not addressed here, or if you have questions
          regarding specific issues when upgrading, please direct these
          questions to the archive-access-discuss forum.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Spring upgrade information">
        <p>
          New features with the <b>@</b> mark indicate features that will directly
          impact Spring XML configuration files used with 1.2.X. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.http.FileLocationDB</b> now:
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.locationdb.BDBResourceFileLocationDB</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.http.FileLocationDBServlet</b> now:
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.locationdb.ResourceFileLocationDBServlet</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.http.ArcProxyServlet</b> now:
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.locationdb.FileProxyServlet</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              All ReplayUI implementations changed completely, now located in:
              ArchivalUrlReplay.xml, DomainPrefixReplay.xml, ProxyReplay.xml.
              Customizations to jspInserts should be straightforward on
              inspecting these files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.Http11ResourceStore</b> now:
              <b>org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.SimpleResourceStore</b>. See
              RemoteCollection.xml for configuration example.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new automatic indexing is most simply upgraded by modifying
              the new example in BDBCollection.xml with your custom paths.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name=".jsp upgrade information">
        <p>
          New features with the <b>*</b> mark indicate features that will directly
          impact customizations made to .jsp files used with 1.2.X. The bulk of
          the changes fit three categories:
          <ul>
            <li>
              class name and package changes requiring import tag updates.
              Please see .jsps in new distribution for updated packages.
            </li>
            <li>
              .jsp path changes due to webapp directory tree cleanup. Again,
              please see the current locations in the new distribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Java changes within .jsp files due to UIResults refactoring.
                Previously each type of response page had a unique class used
                to marshal context information to the .jsp files. These have all
                been refactored into a single class, 
                <b>org.archive.wayback.core.UIResults</b> which has methods to
                access the appropriate data in each case. Additionally, many
                convenience methods that were present on the various UI*Results
                classes have been removed, since convenience methods are now
                available on the core classes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>WaybackRequest</li>
                <li>CaptureSearchResult</li>
                <li>CaptureSearchResults</li>
                <li>UrlSearchResult</li>
                <li>UrlSearchResults</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              As an example, the Timestamp class is no longer used in the .jsp
              files, since all time information uses the Date class for
              localization. All of the above classes now have methods to
              directly return Dates.
              </p>
              <p>
                For specific examples, please see the reference .jsp files
                included with the new distribution.
              </p>
            </li>

      <subsection name="Features">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Now explicitly sets the <b>charset</b> component of replayed HTML
            page <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP headers in Archival URL mode. This
            overrides Tomcat's default behavior of explicitly setting this value
            to Tomcat's <b>default</b> encoding character set, if a document 
            does not set it explicitly. The original <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP
            header value is now returned as HTTP header
            <b>X-Wayback-Orig-Content-Type</b>.

            Previously only updated "import url(URL);" content.
          </li>
          <li>
            fixed Replay redirect loop when using RemoteResourceIndex

            subsequent captures are not saved because they have not changed.
          </li>
          <li>
