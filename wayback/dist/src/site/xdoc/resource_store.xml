      <subsection name="FileLocationDB">
        <p>
          The Location Database provides a mapping between ARC/WARC file names 
          and the absolution location of those ARC/WARC files. Absolute 
          location, in this case, can refer to either HTTP URLs or absolute 
          paths to files on the local file system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever locations are added for a new filename that was not 
          previously present in the location database, a record (in this case a
          line) is added to a log file. This log file can then be used to 
          determine which files have been seen by the location database. The
          ResourceFileLocationDatabase interface includes methods to retrieve
          the current length of this log file, and to return an iterator with
          all records between two points in the log. This interface allows an
          observer to poll the location database to create events when new files
          are added to the underlying database.

      <subsection name="Automatic Indexing Components">
          <p>
            Wayback includes 5 Thread/Worker classes to enable automatic indexing
            of new content:
            <img src="images/AutoIndexing.png" />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ResourceFileSourceUpdater</b> is responsible for repeatedly
                scanning one or more ResourceFileSource instances, creating 
                manifests of the files seen in each, and handing the manifests
                off to the ResourceFileLocationDBUpdater. In the future, for
                larger installations, with 100s to 1000s of machines holding
                ARC/WARC files, multiple instances of this component may run in
                parallel.
              </li>
                <li>
                <b>ResourceFileLocationDBUpdater</b> is responsible for noticing
                new manifests appearing in an incoming directory, and merging
                the contents of those manifests with the actual location database,
                which is currently implemented using a BDBJE database.
              </li>
                <li>
                <b>IndexQueueUpdater</b> is responsible for polling the location
                database log, and adding newly discovered ARC/WARC files to the
                IndexQueue. 
              </li>
                <li>
                <b>IndexWorker</b> is responsible for polling the IndexQueue, and
                when file names are present in the queue, creating an index of
                all resources in the ARC/WARC file, and handing the results to
                the LocalResourceIndexUpdater. In the future, for larger
                installations, multiple instances of this component may run in
                parallel on multiple hosts, or this entire component may be 
                replaced by a distributed Hadoop indexing implementation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>LocalResourceIndexUpdater</b> is responsible for noticing new
                index result files appearing in an incoming directory, and merging
                those results with an existing LocalResourceIndex. Currently the
                only provided LocalResourceIndex that can be updated based on an
                underlying BDBJE database, but future implementation may maintain
                a set of sorted CDX files, or a combination of CDX files and a 
                BDBJE database. 
              </li>

    <section name="org.archive.wayback.ResourceStore implementations">
      <p>
        Wayback allows for several configurations enabling diverse collection
        sizes and distribution of ARC/WARC files across many local directories
        or across many servers. For most configurations, the default
        LocationDBResourceStore will suffice, but Wayback is distributed with
        2 additional classes, FileProxy and SimpleResourceStore, which
        provide an opportunity to insert a single HTTP caching server between
        the Wayback service and an ARC/WARC storage cluster.
      </p>

      <subsection name="LocationDBResourceStore">
        <p>
          This implementation uses a LocationDB to convert ARC/WARC filenames
          into absolute paths, or HTTP URLs. The underlying LocationDB can be
          managed by the automatic indexing threads as described above, or it
          can be manually managed with the <i>location-client</i> command line
          tool. Be sure to enable the 
          org.archive.wayback.resourcestore.locationdb.FileProxyServlet
          if you plan to manage the LocationDB manually.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="SimpleResourceStore">
      	<p>
      	  This configuration depends on all ARC/WARC files appearing within a
      	  single HTTP 1.1 exported root directory, or within a single local
      	  directory. ARC/WARC file names are appended to a common prefix, either
      	  a local directory on the host running Wayback, or under a single 
      	  remote directory.
      	</p>
      	<p>
          The FileProxyServlet can be used to make all ARC/WARC files accessible
          within a single HTTP directory, acting as a reverse proxy to the 
          actual host holding the ARC/WARC files. The FileProxyServlet uses a
          LocationDB to translate requested ARC/WARC filenames into the actual
          location of each file.
      	</p>

    <section name="Telling Wayback where to look for your ARC/WARC files">
      <p>
        When using the automatic indexing functionality, you need to provide a
        list of ResourceFileSource objects to the ResourceFileSourceUpdater
        class. Wayback currently contains 2 ResourceFileSource implementations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>DirectoryResourceFileSource</b> will recursively scan a local
            directory for ARC/WARC files (ending with: .arc, .arc.gz, .warc,
            or .warc.gz). The 'name' property of each
            DirectoryResourceFileSource must be unique, and consist of valid
            filename characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>JspUrlResourceFileSource</b> is a highly experimental 
            implementation which executes a local .jsp file, passing the 'url'
            parameter to the .jsp. The local .jsp is expected to produce output
            of the form (NAME URL) for all ARC/WARC files appearing under the
            argument url prefix, presumably by parsing the directory index HTML
            from the server hosting 'url'.
          </li>
        </ul>
