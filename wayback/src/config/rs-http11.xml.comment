HEADER: Remote-HTTP1.1 ResourceStore
This section contains configuration for accessing ARC file data via HTTP 1.1
from remote servers. This configuration requires all nodes that hold ARC files
to run an HTTP 1.1 server, and maps ARC files to their actual location with
a BDB JE database. The database must be populated using either the
location-client or the pipeline-client scripts included with the distribution.
