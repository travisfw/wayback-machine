HEADER: Local-ARC ResourceStore	
This section contains configuration for accessing ARC files from a single
directory on a local filesystem. If ARC files are spread across multiple
local directories, a single directory be created, and populated with symbolic
links to the various locations of the ARC files. This configuration section also 
contains specific configuration for an indexing thread, which can optionally
notice new ARC files, generate CDX flat files for new ARCs, and hand off these
CDX files to a BDB resource index for merging.
