HEADER: Local-ARC ResourceStore	
This section contains configuration for accessing ARC files from a single
directory on a local filesystem. If ARC files are spread across multiple
local directories, a single directory be created, and populated with symbolic
links to the various locations of the ARC files. This configuration will
also allow the IndexPipeline to scan the directory named in the 'arcpath'
configuration to notice and automatically index new ARC files as they arrive.
