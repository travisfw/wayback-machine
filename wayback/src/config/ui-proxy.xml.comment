HEADER: Proxy UI	
This section contains configuration for accessing content from the wayback
machine as a proxy server. Client browsers are configured to make all web
requests through the wayback machine, and it will serve content from ARC
files instead of from the original websites. This section also contains
configuration for serving XML index queries, which allows a firefox plugin
toolbar to retrieve a list of all versions of the current document being viewed.
