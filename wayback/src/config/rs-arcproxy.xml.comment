HEADER: ArcProxy/LocationDB Servlet Package
This section contains configuration for a standalone webapp that implements
a singleton FileLocationDB for multiple Wayback applications using the same 
dataset. This has several purposes:
1) there is a single location DB to update
2) allows "reverse proxying" of all ARC files on a backend network, making them
appear to be in a single exported directory.

This should be the only configuration active in a separate webapp, if used.
