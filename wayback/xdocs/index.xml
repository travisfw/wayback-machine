        <p><b>wayback</b> is an open source java implementation of the
        The Internet Archive Wayback Machine.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first revision is intended to operate as a standalone webapp. 
        It currently supports Archival URL queries, similar to the current 
        Wayback Machine, and hopefully soon will integrate fully with 
        Heritrix to provide browsing of crawled data as it is crawled.
        </p>
        <p>
        This version includes some basic ARC file indexing, so it can be directed to
        scan for and automatically index new content in the location that Heritrix 
        is writing output ARC files.
